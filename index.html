<h2>FIT3179 Assignment Visualization By Ruben Nathaniel (30149487)</h2>


<h2>This is the first visualisation</h2>
<center> <div id="choropleth_map"></div>
<p style="color:red"> This map visualization shows the number of death counts per 100000 as of October 31st 2020 for all Asian Countries. As you can see, Bangladesh has the highest Death Counts Per 100000. This is probably caused by the fact the country is economically bad despite being densely populated.</p>

<h2>This is the second visualisation</h2>
<center> <div id="vis1"></div>
<p style="color:red"> This ascending ordered bar graph shows the recovery rate of each Asian countries. The recovery rate is calculated by dividing the number of recovered cases by number of positive cases and multiplying it by 100 to get the percentage. From this bar graph it can be concluded that the countries with higher income usually have higher recovery rate because usually they have more access to healthcare services.</p>
  
<h2>This is the third visualisation</h2>
<center> <div id="vis2"></div>
<p style="color:red"> This descending ordered bar graph shows the fatality rate of each Asian Countries. The death rate is calculated by dividing the number of death cases by number of positive cases and multiplying it by 100 to get the percentage. From this bar graph it can be seen that Yemen has extremely high fatality rate. This is because Yemen’s already collapsing healthcare system is buckling as the coronavirus pandemic hits an infrastructure already devastated by five years of war. Right now there are most probably only now 10 healthcare workers for every 10 000 people, less than half the World Health Organization benchmark as stated by MedGlobal(2020).</p>
